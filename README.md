# GoRun
### Data analytics for running
GoRun will take in *running stats* and a print out the average number of *calories burned per mile* for my data tracked on Strava over approximately a year (*51 runs total*). 
Currently taking a break from this project to focus on my independent study on anomaly detection. Hoping to be able to utilize what I learn with this project.
